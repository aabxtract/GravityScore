# **App Name**: Gravity Score

## Core Features:

- User Action Tracking: Track user actions (posting, interacting, staking) and add mass accordingly; store on-chain.
- Gravity Score Calculation: Calculate a Gravity Score for each user based on their mass, representing their influence.
- Reward Attraction: Implement mechanics for users with higher Gravity Scores to attract random airdrops (tokens/NFTs), rare items, or boosts.
- Leaderboard Display: Display a dynamic leaderboard of top users based on their Gravity Score with real-time updates using Web3 subscriptions.
- Gravity Map Visualization: Visualize users as planets in a gravity map, with the size of the planet proportional to their mass.
- NFT Minting: Allow users to mint Gravity Orbs (NFTs) based on mass milestones. Orbs should evolve based on cumulative mass.  A tool to check milestone requirements should be offered.
- Airdrop Randomization: A tool leveraging Chainlink VRF for fair, on-chain randomization of airdrops. This involves verifying that a milestone has been met and choosing to execute or not based on whether the verification tool responds positively.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep space purple (#4A2975) to evoke a cosmic atmosphere.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#121212) for a dark theme, providing contrast to visual elements.
- Accent color: Electric indigo (#6F5FD9) to highlight interactive elements and calls to action, ensuring they stand out.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif, to maintain a clean, modern aesthetic across all text elements.
- Use minimalist vector icons representing cosmic elements such as planets, stars, and gravity wells.
- Cosmic and minimal layout with floating particle animations and planet visualizations on the home page. Ensure a focus on interactive elements with smooth transitions.
- Use smooth, physics-like animations to simulate gravity pull and mass interactions, enhancing the immersive user experience.
